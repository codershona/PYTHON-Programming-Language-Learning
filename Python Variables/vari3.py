# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

# Example
# x = "John"
# # is the same as
# x = 'John'

x = "John"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 'John'
print(x)


# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# Remember that variable names are case-sensitive.
