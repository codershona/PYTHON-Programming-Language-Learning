# Multi Line Comments
# Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

# Example
# #This is a comment
# #written in
# #more than just one line
# print("Hello, World!")

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
