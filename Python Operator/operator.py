# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators
# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

# Operator	|Name	         |Example	
# +	        |Addition	     |x + y	
# -	        |Subtraction	 |x - y	
# *	        |Multiplication  |x * y	
# /	        |Division	     |x / y	
# %	        |Modulus	     |x % y	
# **	    |Exponentiation	 |x ** y	
  //	    |Floor division	 |x // y

  
  
# Addition :


x = 5
y = 3

print(x + y)


# Subtraction :

x = 5
y = 3

print(x - y)

# Multiplication:

x = 5
y = 3

print(x * y)

# 	Division :

x = 12
y = 3

print(x / y)


# 	Modulus :

x = 5
y = 2

print(x % y)


# Exponentiation :

x = 2
y = 5

print(x ** y) #same as 2*2*2*2*2

# Floor division :

x = 15
y = 2

print(x // y)

#the floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number
